\item{D}{A vector of two treatment arms differences for each stratum, Default: c(0.15, 0.15, 0.15)}

\item{d}{A vector of ambiguous region for each stratum, Default: c(0.05, 0.05, 0.05)}

\item{prop.strat}{The sample size proportion for two strata, Default: c(0.2, 0.3, 0.5)}

\item{study}{Could be either "Constrained" or "Origin" for the two type of study design, Default: 'Constrained'}

\item{S}{Number of simulation}

\item{cluster}{Number of parallel running CPU cores, Default: 6}

\item{order_list}{A list of strata order allowing for partial ordering grouped in a vector within a list.}
