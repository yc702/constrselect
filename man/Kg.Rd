\title{Function used for constrained likelihood optimization}
\usage{
Kg(x, qn, nrisk, nevent, event_time, event_ind)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Time we are interested in comparing.}

\item{qn}{Parameter we are optimizing which survival probability at time x is exp(qn).}

\item{nrisk}{A vector of number at risk for each event time.}

\item{nevent}{A vector representing the number of event.}

\item{event_time}{A vector of event times, could be either having event of censored time.}

\item{event_ind}{A vector of event indicator (1, 0).}
}
\value{
A value of intermediate result K for later profile loglikelihood function optimization.
