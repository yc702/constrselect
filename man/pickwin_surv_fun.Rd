\arguments{
\item{maxn}{Number of patients need to be accrued for each treatment arm.}

\item{prop}{The sample size proportion for each stratum, Default: c(0.2, 0.3, 0.5).}

\item{surv_inf}{The exponential survival probability for patients in the inferior treatment arm.}

\item{surv_sup}{The exponential survival probability for patients in the superior treatment arm.}

\item{d}{A vector of ambiguous region for each stratum survival probability, Default: c(0.05, 0.05, 0.05).}

\item{arrival_rate}{The poisson arrival rate for patients, number of patients accrued each month/year.}

\item{FUP}{Additional follow up time after the last patient is accrued.}

\item{x}{Time we are interested in comparing.}

\item{S}{Number of simulation.}

\item{study}{Could be either "Constrained" or "Origin" for the two type of study design, Default: 'Constrained'.}

\item{cluster}{Number of parallel running CPU cores, Default: 6.}

\item{order_list}{A list of strata order allowing for partial ordering grouped in a vector within a list.
Example 1: \code{list(1,2,3)} means 3 stratum are in full ordering 1<2<3.
Example 2: \code{list(1,c(2,3))} means 3 stratum are in partial ordering 1<2, 1<3 and there is no ordering between stratum 2 and 3.}

\item{with_seed}{Random seed for simulation, Default: NULL.}
}
\value{
A data frame of survival probability, correct and error decision for each simulated scenario.
}
\description{
