Description: Provides functions for probabilities estimation 
  with some natural order constraints which may exist in 
  stratified population to gain statistical efficiency for 
  randomized phase II selection designs. This package is intended for use 
  for both binary and survival outcomes and is described in detail in Chen and Yu (2023).
